# HW-Wireframe 

### By Denis Galo

## HTML Explanation

For the html I attempted to make it as close as possible as the example. In the body I added the header and the nav tags and a <br> in between to create that break. Then I added the section tag within the tag I added the other groups which contained the article, h,and p. Then for the aside it was tricky to  get it to the right height to I had to add a few div to make up for that empty space in the box. After that I added the footer and finished the html by adding the closing tags.

## Css Explanation

In the Css I first added the * and I included the text align to center then the padding for all parts of the html to 20px. For the body I added the font family type the color, background color and the main width to 960px, I included the font size to 18px. For the header and the nav I added the color #ebebeb and width 100%. For the left section I added the float left and 50%width. For the article part I included the color #ebebeb. For h and p I had to inver the colors. For the aside I had trouble making it appear on the right. I had to play around with the margins and add float right to get it to show up properly.

## Notes

Something that I could have done differently is that to try to organize the code a bit better in the html, and maybe I could have condensed some of the code in the css.
